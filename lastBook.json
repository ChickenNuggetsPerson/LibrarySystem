{"title":"The Whipping Boy","authors":["Sid Fleischman"],"publishedDate":"1986","description":"Amanda Rosenbloom, proprietor of Astor Place Vintage, thinks shee(tm)son just another call to appraise and possibly purchase clothing from a wealthy, elderly woman. But after discovering a journal sewn into a fur muff, Amanda gets much more than she anticipated. The pages of the journal reveal the life of Olive Westcott, a young woman who had moved to Manhattan in 1907. Olive was set on pursuing a career as a department store buyer in an era when Victorian ideas, limiting a womane(tm)s sphere to marriage and motherhood, were only beginning to give way to modern ways of thinking. As Amanda reads the journal, her life begins to unravel until she can no longer ignore this voice from the past. Despite being separated by one hundred years, Amanda finds shee(tm)s connected to Olive in ways neither could ever have imagined.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"OTHER","identifier":"PSU:000058486122"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":100,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["JUVENILE FICTION"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.2.2.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1HfWAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1HfWAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1HfWAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780439441421&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1HfWAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:9780439441421&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Whipping_Boy.html?hl=&id=1HfWAAAAMAAJ","isbn":"9780439441421"}
